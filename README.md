## Work
I like to use AI to build projects from abstracted ideas. Most of the code is AI generated, and a lot of the documenation also (with recent projects).

### [GenSlop](https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/GenSlop)
Some projects that automatically write documentation by scraping data/using source code. 

### [LLM-TESTING](https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/LLM-TESTING)
The LLM-TESTING repository organizes various benchmark ideas for evaluating large language models (LLMs), focusing on structured testing methodologies such as chess gameplay and token complexity assessments. 


### [Entity-Resolution](https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/Entity-Resolution)
The Entity-Resolution repository serves as a prototype for linking records to real-world identities, addressing challenges in accurately associating data when definitive identifiers are absent or inconsistent.
