## Work
### GenDoc
GenDoc is a Python-based tool designed to automatically generate layered documentation from existing codebases, progressing from detailed method descriptions to high-level project overviews through multi-agent prompt orchestration. Targeted at developers and technical teams, it allows for customizable documentation generation using either a mock language model or the OpenAI API, producing structured outputs alongside supporting artifacts.

### GHProfScanner
The GHProfScanner is a command-line tool that analyzes GitHub profiles by scraping public repository metadata and contribution history, generating a markdown report using an LLM, primarily OpenAI. It is designed for developers and data analysts who need to summarize GitHub activity and documentation, with configurable options for focusing on specific repositories or documentation files. Repository: https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/GHProfScanner


### weBot
The `weBot` repository is a Python-based project aimed at developing a web bot capable of simulating human-like interactions on social media platforms, although it is currently non-functional and not deployed due to terms of service violations. The project is in its early stages, focusing on integrating libraries like Selenium for web automation and implementing basic decision-making capabilities, with the long-term goal of creating a more autonomous bot. Repository: https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/weBot


### LLM-TESTING
The LLM-TESTING repository organizes various benchmark ideas for evaluating large language models (LLMs), focusing on structured testing methodologies such as chess gameplay and token complexity assessments. It targets developers and researchers interested in benchmarking LLM performance through customizable scenarios and detailed telemetry for analysis. Repository: https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/LLM-TESTING


### Entity-Resolution
The Entity-Resolution repository serves as a prototype for linking records to real-world identities, addressing challenges in accurately associating data when definitive identifiers are absent or inconsistent. It is particularly relevant for financial institutions and other sectors that require reliable verification of identities to comply with regulations and prevent fraud.
