## Work
I like to use AI to build projects from abstracted ideas. Most of the code is AI generated, and a lot of the documenation also (with recent projects).
### GenDoc
GenDoc is a Python-based tool designed to automatically generate layered documentation from existing codebases, progressing from detailed method descriptions to high-level project overviews through multi-agent prompt orchestration. Repository: https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/GenDoc


### GHProfScanner
The GHProfScanner is a command-line tool that analyzes GitHub profiles by scraping public repository metadata and contribution history, generating a markdown report using an LLM, primarily OpenAI. Repository: https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/GHProfScanner


### weBot (depricated)
The `weBot` repository is a Python-based project aimed at developing a web bot capable of simulating human-like interactions on social media platforms, although it is currently non-functional and not deployed due to terms of service violations. The project is in its early stages, focusing on integrating libraries like Selenium for web automation and implementing basic decision-making capabilities, with the long-term goal of creating a more autonomous bot.

### LLM-TESTING
The LLM-TESTING repository organizes various benchmark ideas for evaluating large language models (LLMs), focusing on structured testing methodologies such as chess gameplay and token complexity assessments. Repository: https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/LLM-TESTING


### Entity-Resolution
The Entity-Resolution repository serves as a prototype for linking records to real-world identities, addressing challenges in accurately associating data when definitive identifiers are absent or inconsistent. Repository: https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/Entity-Resolution
