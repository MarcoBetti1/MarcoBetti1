## Spotlight
MarcoBetti1 demonstrates strong proficiency in Python, with significant contributions to projects focused on documentation automation, web automation, and entity resolution. His repositories, such as GenDoc and Entity-Resolution, cater to developers and data scientists, providing tools for streamlining documentation processes and implementing data consistency techniques. Additionally, projects like LLM-TESTING and llmchess explore the evaluation of large language models, offering structured methodologies for performance assessment. 

## Work
### GenDoc
GenDoc is a Python-based tool designed to automatically generate layered documentation from existing codebases, utilizing multi-agent prompt orchestration to create outputs ranging from detailed method descriptions to high-level project overviews. It targets developers looking to streamline documentation processes, offering features such as integration with existing Markdown files and support for different LLM providers, including a mock option for testing without external credentials. https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/GenDoc 


### weBot
The [weBot](https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/weBot) repository aims to create a web bot capable of simulating human interactions on social media platforms, with an eventual goal of developing more autonomous behaviors. Currently, the project is in an experimental phase, utilizing Python and Selenium for web automation, and is intended for developers interested in bot creation and social media interaction, although it is noted that the bot may not function as intended and is against the terms of service of the platforms it targets.


### LLM-TESTING
The [LLM-TESTING](https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/LLM-TESTING) repository organizes various benchmark ideas for evaluating large language models (LLMs), focusing on structured testing methodologies such as chess gameplay and attention mechanisms. It provides tools for capturing model performance metrics and allows users to manipulate variables like opponent types and prompt styles, making it suitable for researchers and developers interested in LLM evaluation and optimization.


### Entity-Resolution
The [Entity-Resolution](https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/Entity-Resolution) repository serves as a prototype for linking records to real-world identities, addressing challenges in data consistency and verification, particularly when definitive identifiers are absent or inconsistent. It targets developers and data scientists working in fields such as finance and data governance, providing a framework for implementing entity resolution techniques, including normalization and fuzzy matching.
